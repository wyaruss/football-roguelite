def coverageBattle(receiver, defender):
    #Establish composite scores (should this be done here or in class functions?)

    #Does receiver run a successful route?
    #Does defender successfully cover?

    #STEP 1: Route Running (+Speed) vs Coverage (+Speed)
    #Success for either player leads to a significant bonus on Step 2

    #STEP 2: Catch vs Ball Skills
    #If one player succeeds and the other does not, successful player wins the rep 
    #If neither player succeeds, then the tie goes to whichever player rolls higher
    #If both players succeed, then the tie goes to whichever player rolls higher
